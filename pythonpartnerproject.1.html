<h2>Python Partner Project: </h2>
<font size="3" allign="right">Me and my partner decided to make a quiz where the question were chosen at random. The quiz will enhance your mentall abillities. some difficulties that we faced during the process of this mentally quiz was make it pick random question and make it choose that question with its answers. After that, we had a promblem with the randomizer, but the solution to that was to set the global value of the varialble. In the end, we were able to develop the quiz that enhances your mentall abilities.
