<text>On May 2019, me and my partner Shun decided to make a simple arduino project. The project was to make a buzzer sound when a button is clicked and also displayed in the LCD. When starting the project we messed up with the code the programming language was C++. The promblem of the code was that we mixed up the piezo buzzer and the button. Inorder for the code to work as it intention to we set the numbers that were intenetioned for the piezo buzzer and button. After that, we have misplaced the button on the arduino board so we had to put the button back on the place the button was set to on the board. Overall, we were able to accomplish our goals by pressing a button and everytime a button is press it shows the clicks in the LCD connected to the arduino board and able to make sound with the piezo buzzer.   </text>
