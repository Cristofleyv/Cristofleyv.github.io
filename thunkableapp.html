<font size="3">In my app, I decided to take more of a focus towards a aim focus game for mobile.After that, 
I decided to have theme for the game. The theme was from this game called “Clash of Clans”. 
Then, I got some of the character from that game and deigned to move random.
During this process, I had a problem with the game crashing, the problem was I created random 
generator and it kept looping, so it overloaded the game, to fix this Instead of creating a loop I created 
a command called “random” and it fixed it. After that, I had to create a bar selection in the bottom, 
so you are able to pick what character you would like to click.
During that development, I had problem creating a noise when clicking the character you wanted. 
I fixed by creating an audio command when click this character it will make the sound I provide.
In the end, the game created was the first mobile game I ever made.
